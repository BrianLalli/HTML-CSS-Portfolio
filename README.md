# Web Page Accessibility

## Project Description:
This Challenge was the second homework assignment of the UTA-Bootcamp. Our task was to write the code from scratch to create our future portfolio. The acceptance criteria is focused on functionality of the links and responsivness.

## Summary:

I worked really hard to make the page resemble the mock we were given, and ultimately spent too much time on aesthetics at the cost of functionality. I am very proud of my work because I wrote all of this code from scratch and was able to apply a significant amount of CSS styling that I learned in class.
