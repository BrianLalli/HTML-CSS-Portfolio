# Portfolio

## Project Description:
This Challenge was the second homework assignment of the UTA-Bootcamp. Our task was to write the code from scratch to create our future portfolio. The acceptance criteria is focused on functionality of the links and responsiveness. Therefore, in the navigation bar, the user can click one of the links and be directed to the section of the page, respectively. Lastly, links to my email, GitHub, and LinkedIn will direct users accordingly.
